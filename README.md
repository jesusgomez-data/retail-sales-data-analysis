# Retail Sales & Customer Behavior Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project simulates a retail company operating across multiple cities and sales channels (online and physical stores).  
The goal is to analyze sales performance, customer behavior and product performance using SQL and Python.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- SQLite
- SQL
- Python
- Pandas
- DB Browser for SQLite

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset was fully generated for this project and includes:
- 500+ sales transactions
- Customer data
- Product catalog
- Multiple cities and sales channels
- One full year of sales activity

## 🧱 Database Structure
- **clientes**: customer information

Relational model with primary and foreign keys.

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed
- Total revenue calculation
- Monthly sales trends
- Revenue by sales channel
